# Lesson 1: Getting Started With Java

## Software
- [IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition) - Integrated Development Environment](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-running-your-first-java-application.html?keymap=windows)

## Setup

To get started with Java, the best way to start is with a IDE (also known as an Integrated Development Environment). It's really just a fancy tool that helps make programming easier. There's an "Ultimate" and "Community", so make sure to download the Community edition.

When you get that installed, please follow these instructions for creating your first Java program:
